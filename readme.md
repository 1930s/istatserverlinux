# iStat Server

iStat Server is a system monitoring daemon that is used in conjunction with [iStat for iOS](https://bjango.com/ios/istat/) and [iStat for macOS](https://bjango.com/mac/istat/) to remotely monitor computers.

-----

### Supported OSs
- Linux
- FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and other BSD based OSs
- AIX
- Solaris
- HP-UX (Still in development and not tested)

-----

### Requirements
- C and C++ compilers such as gcc and g++.
- Auto tools (autoconf and automake).
- OpenSSL/libssl + development libraries.
- sqlite3 + development libraries.
- libxml2 + development libraries.

We have a package guide [available](https://bjango.com/help/istat3/linuxpackages/) to help you install all the required packages for your OS.

-----

### Building and starting iStat Server
- [Download](https://download.bjango.com/istatserverlinux.tar.gz) and decompress source
- cd /path/to/istatserver
- ./autogen
- ./configure
- make
- sudo make install
- sudo /usr/local/bin/istatserver -d (daemon mode)


A 5 digit passcode is generated by the install script. It can be found in the preference file, which is generally located at **/usr/local/etc/istatserver/istatserver.conf**. iStat for iOS and iStat for macOS will ask for this passcode the first time you connect to your computer.

-----

### Starting iStat Server at boot
iStat Server does not install any scripts to start itself at boot. Sample scripts for rc.d, upstart and systemd are included in the resources directory. You may need to customize them depending on your OS.
