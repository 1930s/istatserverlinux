Supported OSs

- FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and other BSD based OSs
- AIX
- Solaris
- HP-UX (Still in development and not tested)


Requirements
- C and C++ compilers such as gcc and g++.
- Auto tools (autoconf and automake).

We have a package guide available to help you install all the required packages for your OS - https://bjango.com/help/istat3/linuxpackages/


Building and starting iStat Server
- cd /path/to/istatserver
- ./autogen
- ./configure
- make
- sudo make install
- sudo /usr/local/bin/istatserver -d (daemon mode)

A default passcode is generated on install. It can be found in the preference file, which is generally located at /usr/local/etc/istatserver/istatserver.conf. iStat for iOS and iStat for macOS will ask for this passcode the first time you connect to your computer.
