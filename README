We have a package guide available to help you install all the required packages for your OS - https://github.com/bjango/istatserverlinux/wiki/Package-Guide


Building and starting iStat Server
- cd /path/to/istatserver
- ./autogen
- ./configure
- make
- sudo make install
- sudo /usr/local/bin/istatserver -d (daemon mode)

A default passcode is generated on install. It can be found in the preference file, which is generally located at /usr/local/etc/istatserver/istatserver.conf. iStat View will ask for this passcode the first time you connect to your computer.


Upgrading iStat Server
Upgrades follow the same process as standard installs. Please stop istatserver if its running then run the normal build process.


Example boot scripts for rc.d, upstart and system are located inside the resources folder. You may need to customize these depending on your OS

- sudo cp ./resource/systemd/istatserver.service  /etc/systemd/system/istatserver.service
- sudo service istatserver start

Starting with upstart
- sudo cp ./resource/upstart/istatserver.conf  /etc/init/istatserver.conf
- sudo start istatserver

Starting with rc.d
